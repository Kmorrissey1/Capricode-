# Capricode
This speculative programming interface invites you to use binary code as a way to organize and prioritize time based on memory, activity, and coded timeslots. Building on the archetype of Capricorn, a sign associated with organization and preparedness, the name is a nod to my interest in astrology (I thought about using C, but...that's taken lol)
