# Capricode
This speculative programming interface invites you to use binary code as a way to organize and prioritize time based on memory, activity, and coded timeslots. Building on the archetype of Capricorn, a sign associated with organization and preparedness, the name is a nod to my interest in astrology (I thought about using C, but...that's taken lol)

The first bit is the time, 
The second bit is the activity,
and the third bit is the color you associate with the memory!

Try to map this on the schedule: 

Example: Wednesday afternoon, I got boba. I wore a light pink sweater

Creative Challenge: Fill in the whole day for Tuesday and tell us a story of what happened using the code!
